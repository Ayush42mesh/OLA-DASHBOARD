# OLA-DASHBOARD
This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard for Ola ride analysis, designed to derive meaningful business insights from ride data. The dashboard consists of five pages covering overall performance, vehicle type analysis, revenue trends, ride cancellations, and customer ratings. Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, while DAX measures were used to create key performance indicators and calculations. The dashboard enables users to explore patterns in revenue, identify cancellation trends, compare vehicle-wise performance, and evaluate customer satisfaction through dynamic visualizations and filters. This project is created for analytical and learning purposes and demonstrates practical data analysis and visualization skills using Power BI.
